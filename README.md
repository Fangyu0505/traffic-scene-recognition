# WZ-traffic Dataset

Humans have the remarkable ability to categorize complex traffic scenes very accurately and rapidly, which is important for the inference of the traffic situation and subsequent navigation in the complex and varying driving environment. It will be major achivement to implement an automatic traffic scene recognition system which imitates the human capability to understand traffic scenes. Such a system will play a crucial role toward the success of numerous applications, such as self-driving car/driverless car, traffic mapping and traffic surveillance. Automatic acquisition of information from real-world traffic scenes will also be pivotal to optimize current traffic management system, for example, by improving traffic flow during busy periods.

# Brief Description

The WZ-traffic dataset contains 6035 labeled images of 20 categories: highway, country road, gas station, indoor parking, outdoor parking, crossing, city stress, scenic gate, bridge, car wash, train station, autodrome, traffic circle, tunnel, tunnel entrance, bus station, booth, bus parking and traffic jams. The images were collected by us from both the image search engine as well as personal photographs,  and took into account sufficient variations in the background and viewpoints.
